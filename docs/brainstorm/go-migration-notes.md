# Go migration notes

Bugs found in the Python `orch` while the Go rewrite (see CLAUDE.md → "Migración a Go (en curso)") is in progress get logged here instead of fixed with a new feature or a large refactor in Python. Small, targeted fixes are still fine — this file is for anything that would otherwise tempt scope creep in the version being replaced.

## Open notes

- ~~Stale `jinja2` mentions~~ — **RESOLVED** (g0/sonnet-cleanup): `orchestrator/orch.py`'s
  dashboard-missing-deps hint no longer tells the user to install `jinja2 >= 3.1`, and
  `orchestrator/dashboard/__init__.py`'s module docstring now describes FastAPI serving
  the embedded React SPA instead of calling out `jinja2` as a "heavy import".

- ~~**Frontend leftovers of `board_url`**~~ — **RESOLVED** (g0/sonnet-cleanup, 2026-09-11):
  `frontend/src/lib/types.ts:202`'s `board_url?` field and `frontend/env.example`'s
  `dashboard.board_url` comment are both removed.

- ~~**Project templates wrote snake_case task keys `Task.from_json` doesn't
  read**~~ — **RESOLVED** (g0/sonnet-templates, 2026-09-11): found by opus during
  G0.3 (PR #95). All four `orchestrator/templates/projects/*/tasks.json.tmpl`
  used `estimate_hours` / `spec_ref`, but `Task.from_json` (orchestrator/models.py)
  only reads `estimateHours` / `specRef` — every task scaffolded from a template
  silently got `estimate_hours=0.0` and `spec_ref=""`, so the dashboard ETA showed
  "—" and the dispatch prompt dropped the "Spec ref (READ FIRST)" line for every
  templated project. Renamed the 32 occurrences across the 4 templates; added a
  parametrized regression test (`test_template_tasks_are_readable_by_task_from_json`
  in `orchestrator/tests/test_init.py`) that scaffolds each template and asserts
  every task has `estimate_hours > 0` and a non-empty `spec_ref`.

- **P0 in progress (opus)**: `TokenAuthMiddleware` returns 401 for `index.html`
  and `/assets/*` when no token is present, so a stakeholder URL with `?token=`
  loads the SPA shell but the JS/CSS asset requests (which don't carry the query
  param) 401 and the page stays blank — the token-entry form inside the SPA is
  unreachable because the SPA itself never renders. Being fixed by opus in
  parallel; leaving this open for them to mark resolved.
